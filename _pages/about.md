### Welcome!

I am a research professor at Tonggji University, and affliated at [Department of Economics](https://economics.handels.gu.se/english){:target="_blank"}, [University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english){:target="_blank"}. <!---I obtained my PhD from [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/){:target="_blank"}, [UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles](http://www.ulb.ac.be/){:target="_blank"}.--->

My research interests are market design and economics of innovation. I combine theoretical, empirical, and experimental approaches to explore these issues.
My current [research](https://lichen999.github.io/research/) includes topics on the design of college admissions, social housing allocation, human and algorithm interaction.
