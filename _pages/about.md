### Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at [Department of Economics](https://economics.handels.gu.se/english){:target="_blank"}, [University of Gothenburg](http://www.gu.se/english){:target="_blank"}. I was on parental leave between 2021/03 and 2022/01. I obtained my PhD from [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/){:target="_blank"}, [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](http://www.ulb.ac.be/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are matching market and the design of marketplace, combining theoretical, empirical, and experimental analysis.
My current [research](https://lichen999.github.io/research/) includes topics on school choice allocation, civil servants assignment, social housing allocation, human and algorithm interaction, and emission trading schemes. Please find my [CV](https://lichen999.github.io/CV_lichen.pdf){:target="_blank"} here.
