### Welcome!

I am a Research Professor of Economics at [Tongji University]([http://www.tongji.edu.cn/](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/)){:target="_blank"}, and I am also affiliated with [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en){:target="_blank"}. I have previously studied at [Fudan University](http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"}, [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html){:target="_blank"} and obtained my PhD from [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/){:target="_blank"} at [UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles](http://www.ulb.ac.be/){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are market design and economics of innovation. I combine theoretical, empirical, and experimental approaches to explore these issues.
<!--My current [research](https://lichen999.github.io/research/) includes topics on human and algorithm interaction, college admissions, and green innovation. -->
