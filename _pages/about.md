### Welcome!

I am a research professor of Economics at Tongji University, and affliated at University of Gothenburg. <!---I obtained my PhD from [ECARES](https://ecares.ulb.be/){:target="_blank"}, [UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles](http://www.ulb.ac.be/){:target="_blank"}.--->

My research interests are market design and economics of innovation. I combine theoretical, empirical, and experimental approaches to explore these issues.
<!--My current [research](https://lichen999.github.io/research/) includes topics on human and algorithm interaction, college admissions, and green innovation. -->
